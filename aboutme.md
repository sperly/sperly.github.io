My name is Eric Lind, I tend to not finish my projects.
I have a lot of ideas, but very litle time. (Thats what I say at least!)

### my history

I've been making for all my life. One of the first things i remember I created was a modded phone (back in the early 80's when phones where large made of plastic and had a cord). 
I got hold on several discarded phones and started pulling them apart to see hove they were built. I even created a new shell with cardboard and duct-tape. 

Later on my projects has been a little bit more elaborated.
